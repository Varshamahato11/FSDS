    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid repetition of codes.\n",
    "- Increases program readability and modularity.\n",
    "- Divide a complex problem into simpler ones.\n",
    "- makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "- Reduces chances of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "The def functionName() createes a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:   \n",
    "\n",
    "function :  \n",
    "\n",
    "- is a block of code that does a particular operation and returns a result. It usually accepts inputs as \n",

    "                   \n",
    "function call :  \n",

    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten. we will not be able to \n",
    "\n",
    "access the out side the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an \n",
    "\n",
    "expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "By representing a variable by global keywaord in the body of a function Example : global v \n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "The data type of None is NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "The import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n",
    "\n",
    "areallyourpetsnamederic i not a python module. Importing this module will through ModuleNotFoundError exception.\n",

    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "This function can be called with spam.bacon().\n",
    "\n",

    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause. or\n",
    "\n",
    "we can write lines of code in try block. \n",
    "This will not crash the programme and in except block we can catch the \n",

    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Try : The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "except : The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause, like print statments about exceptions,\n",
    "\n",
